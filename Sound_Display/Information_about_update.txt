These are the files I had in the seperate folder that I managed to get working. I added these files to the "ST7735" project from lab 1 and replaced the main function.


I used timers 2 and 3 for the alarm sound. I used ports E2-5 for the alarm sound, ports A for the display, and ports F for the buttons, which I have not implemented.


I think the behaivor of the alarm should be something like this:

Button 1 switches modes between main menu, set time, set alarm, and set song.

In main menu, the analog and digital clock updates normally.

In set time, pressing 1 button increases the temporary minute counter, and pressing anouther increases the temporary hour counter. Pressing the "set" button permanatly changes the time.

In set alarm, the hour and minute buttons act the same. Pressing the set button sets the alarm at that time, or unsets the alarm.

In set song, pushing either hour or minute button will change the song. Pushing set sets the song.
